    # This Sidekiq middleware collects queue metrics and sends them to telegraf.
    #
    #
    # Tags:
    #
    # * `type`:
    #     One of "job" or "scheduled_job".
    #
    # * `queue`:
    #     The queue this job landed on.
    #
    # * `worker`:
    #     The name of the worker class that was executed.
    #
    # * `errors`:
    #     Whether or not this job errored.
    #
    # * `retry`:
    #     Whether or not this execution was a retry of a previously failed one.
    #
    #
    # Values:
    #
    # * `app_ms`:
    #     Total worker processing time.
    #
    # * `queue_ms`:
    #     How long did this job wait in the queue before being processed?
    #     Only present for "normal" (async) jobs (with tag `type` of "job").
